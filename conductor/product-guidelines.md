# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style
- **Tone:** Academic and Formal. Use precise language and professional terminology consistent with a computer engineering senior project.
- **Clarity:** Ensure all descriptions are concise and objective. Avoid colloquialisms or overly promotional language.
- **Documentation:** When referencing project reports, use their full formal titles (e.g., "High-Level Design Report").

## Visual Identity
- **Layout:** Balanced Grid. Information categories such as Team, Documents, and Project Overview should be presented with equal visual weight to provide a comprehensive and organized summary.
- **Simplicity:** Adhere to a clean, minimalist design that emphasizes content readability. Main container max-width is set to 72rem to optimize screen utilization.
- **Consistency:** Exclusively use the styles defined in `styles.css`. No inline styling or external CSS frameworks unless they are already integrated.

## Content Management
- **Preservation:** Content within "Team & Supervisor", "Repositories", and "Documents" sections must remain accurate and reflect the official project status.
- **No Comments:** Strictly avoid any comments in the HTML or CSS code to maintain a clean source file.
