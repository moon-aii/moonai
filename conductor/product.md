# Product Definition

## Vision
To create a concise and informative web presence for the MoonAI project, serving as a digital poster that showcases the Predator–Prey Neuro-evolution Simulation. The site will provide easy access to project documentation, repository links, team information, and a high-level overview of the simulation's goals and technologies.

## Target Audience
- **Academic Supervisors & Evaluators:** Reviewing project deliverables and specifications.
- **Collaborators & Students:** Interested in the technical details of neuro-evolution and simulation logic.
- **General Public:** Seeking a high-level understanding of the project's concepts.

## Core Features
- **Team & Contact:** Listing of team members and supervisor.
- **Resource Hub:** Direct links to project repositories (Source Code, Documentation Site) and key documentation (PDFs).
- **Detailed Technical Cards:** Synthesized information from project reports covering Motivation, Objective, Approach, NEAT algorithm, Simulation Environment, Heterogeneous Architecture, and Real-Time Analytics.
- **Visual Showcase:** Presentation of the project poster and high-level design concepts.

## Constraints
- **No Comments:** Code comments are strictly prohibited.
- Maintain the existing visual style defined in `styles.css`.
- Preserve specific content sections as requested (Team, Repositories, Documents).
- Static site architecture (HTML/CSS) for GitHub Pages deployment.
