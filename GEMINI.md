## Project Description
MoonAI is a computer engineering senior project focused on a Predator–Prey Neuro-evolution Simulation. The website documents the project and is deployed via GitHub Actions.

## Tasks
1. Update `index.html` with information from `documents/`.
2. Add new cards to the grid.
3. Expand existing "Project Overview" and "Technologies Used" sections.
